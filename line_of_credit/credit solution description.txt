This implementation is supposed to be such that an average user can use it,
to make entries accurately, making sure that no transaction is beyond allowed
limits. It is very easy to use, in that it takes inputs from users and can keep
going from month to month (each month of 30 days each at this point). The physical
input is easy to replace with a system generated input. The way this program works
is that you give it the day of the month and then all transactions on that day in 
order of their taking place. Any transactions that are invalid (withdrawal too high or
deposit too much), are taken care of adequately. At the end of a month, the user has an
option to move to the next month or end the simulation. The balance amount carries over
from month to month, implying that if you spent all your credit last month and have not
repaid, then the credit limit for this month is ), ie, your balances from the previous
month impact this month, as is the case with most credit cards.
